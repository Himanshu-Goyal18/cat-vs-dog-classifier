# Cat vs Dog Classifier

## Overview
This project features a Cat vs Dog classifier based on a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). It effectively differentiates between images of cats and dogs by learning intricate features through multiple layers of neural networks.

**Purpose or motivation**:  
To explore deep learning for image classification, specifically distinguishing between cats and dogs. Potential applications include automated pet identification and image organization tools.

**Datasets used**:  
Trained on the "Dogs vs. Cats" dataset from Kaggle, containing 25,000 images evenly split between cats and dogs.

## Installation
1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Himanshu-Goyal18/cat-vs-dog-classifier.git
